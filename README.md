The circuit displayed above might be helpful for testing the RF output of RF transmitters.

The best feature of this detector circut is that it does not use any power source or battery. The detected RF signal is itself used for illuminating the LED1. But remember the LED must be high bright, RED SMD type LED.

If you have an amateur radio or CB transmitter which needs to be tested, switch ON the transmitter and the antenna of this circuit at touching distance of the RF transmitter antenna. You will find the LED1 turning on if the transmitter is emitting RF.

The circuit might be constructed inside a tiny metal or plastic box. A simple length of wire or a pull-up alternative antenna from an old TV or CB equipment could be used for the antenna.
